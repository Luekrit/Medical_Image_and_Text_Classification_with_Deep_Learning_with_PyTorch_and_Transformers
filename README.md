# 🧠 Medical Image & Text Classification with Deep Learning
### PyTorch CNN + DistilBERT NLP | Responsible AI | Reproducible ML Pipeline

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end deep learning pipeline** for both **medical image classification** and **natural language classification** using modern deep learning techniques.

The project demonstrates real-world ML engineering practices, including:

- Handling imbalanced datasets  
- Designing custom CNN architectures  
- Fine-tuning transformer models  
- Experiment tracking and evaluation  
- Responsible AI and data governance principles  

The goal is to simulate production-style AI workflows commonly used in **healthcare, cybersecurity, and regulated industries**.
